- test if bash is up to date, tell the user to update it with brew if
  he is on macOS
- do not count the tail block in collide_test (just give it SNAKE[$TAIL])
  and if it is equal to $NEW_HEAD, return 0 (not a collision)
- see if there's more to be removed (if this shit can be simplified)
- maybe add the possibility to move through the walls
- maybe handle resize
- maybe handle stop signal (reset the terminal when leaving, and clear
  the screen when coming back)
- add a difficulty option (change speed, the value of the read timeout)
- make it so that the scores are only kept in the source directory, not
  wherever the user launches the game
